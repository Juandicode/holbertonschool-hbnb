# HBnB – Part 3: Enhanced Backend with Authentication and Database Integration

This repository contains the third part of the HBnB project: a secure, database‑backed backend powered by Flask, SQLAlchemy, JWT authentication, and role‑based access control. In this stage you replace in‑memory storage with a persistent relational database, introduce user authentication and authorization, and produce a visual model of your schema with Mermaid.js.

  SQLite in development, easily switchable to MySQL for production.

- **CRUD Endpoints**  
  Full create, read, update, and delete operations for Users, Places, Reviews, and Amenities.

- **Data Validation & Security**  
  Bcrypt password hashing, request payload validation, and proper HTTP status codes.

- **Schema Visualization**  
  ER diagram rendered for clear documentation of relationships.
